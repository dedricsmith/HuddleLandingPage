## My process

For the project I took a mobile first approach. Building the page from 320px and expanded from there. For this project I really wanted to get flexbox down to a T. I think I achieved that goal and now very comfortable using flexbox.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sematic HTML

### What I learned

- Mobile first workflow
- Got really comfortable using flexbox
- Use of media queries

### Continued development

- Continue to improve my Sematic HTML
- Start using the BEM naming convention with CSS
- Improve my mobile first workflow
